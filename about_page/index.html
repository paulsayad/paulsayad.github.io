			<img class="pic-large" src="img/why.png"> I never really knew what I wanted to pursue in my life until I took my first Computer Science course in my junior year of high school. I took a Web Programming class and ever since then I fell in love with programming. Currently I am taking more advanced level courses and having more fun than ever with CS!
