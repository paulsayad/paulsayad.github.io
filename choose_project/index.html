			<p> After a great day of fun at your best friends house, you decide its time to head home. You look at your watch and see its 7:00, and you realized you will be late for your steak dinner. You have to get home quickly because if you are late your mom will cut you a salami sandwich instead of having the steak. Right before you leave you think you see something in the woods so you are hesitant to go through the woods but you want to go through them so you can get home quickly. </p>
